# Conclusion

  Some limitations in the data provided such as missing song features and genres could be an interesting direction for future work, such as querying the Spotify API to fill in the missing data. Additionally, for plots that used genre, it could be interesting to play around with the genre assignment in initial data cleaning to see if there are other insights that we might have missed or use another database for assigning a single genre to a song. Finally, with so many dimensions to our dataset, there are definitely many other questions that are left unanswered with our exploration. If we had the time, we would have liked to explore derived metrics such as changes in position on the charts. Some lessons that we’ve learned are to make sure to work piece by piece, and that changes to the Bookdown work incrementally, instead of trying to merge everything all at once. The same lesson can be applied to the interactive plot. Get started early, and explore your data as you go. Make sure that plots make sense logically, and deep dive into the data when it doesn’t (using Excel is a great way to verify what you’re doing in R or d3). It also helps to come up with the question that your plot is trying to answer first and sketch out what the visualization might look like, before making a plot. Overall, our team had a lot of fun exploring and analyzing the Billboard Top 100 and the Spotify audio features datasets, and look forward to future analyses as well.
