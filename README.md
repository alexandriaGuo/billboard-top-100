# Billboard Top 100 Song Trends
In this project we aim to explore various trends that define popular songs and musical genres, using data from the Billboard Top 100 song charts and Spotify's song descriptors.

## Dataset
The data for this project comes from the [Tidy Tuesday project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-09-14), which consists of Billboard's Top 100 weekly song charts from the years of 1958 - 2021, and descriptive characteristics about these songs provided by Spotify. The Billboard data provides features such as `song`, `performer`, `week_position`, and `weeks_on_chart`. Spotify provides song attributes that include, but are not limited to `genre`, `danceability`,
`key`, `energy`, `valence`, and `loudness`, and `speechiness`.  

## Questions
Some questions that we aim to explore in this project include:
1. *What are the musical qualities that define genre?* We aim to explore patterns in song descriptors that may characterize genres, particularly between K-pop and American pop.
2. *What musical qualities define a popular song?* We look to summarize the song characteristics of the most popular songs on the Billboard charts to determine if there are any trends.
3. *Have popular songs changed overtime?* We investigate various time-based trends in song popularity, such as in seasonality and how various genres, such as K-pop, have emerged in popularity over the years.
